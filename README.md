# Nefera

Nefera is a role-based school wellbeing and governance platform.

This repository follows a monorepo structure:
- `backend/` — Core API, authentication, RBAC, and privacy logic
- `frontend/` — Reserved for frontend implementation (handled separately)

Frontend is intentionally scaffolded to maintain a clear separation of concerns.
